# bed.php
REST-oriented PHP micro-framework. The idea behind it is to provide the minimum
amount of functionality that allows writing REST APIs comfortably, without
compromising performance or conditioning too much system-specific architecture
decisions. To accomplish that, the framework puts together components common to
virtually every REST API, and no more. In turn, the use of PHP native features
is encourage, as they are many times sufficient for most of the cases, and very
well documented.

Requires PHP >= 7.
